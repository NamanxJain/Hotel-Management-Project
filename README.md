# üë®‚Äçüç≥ Hotel Management Project

## Project Description
Hotel Management Project is an **Web based Hotel Management Project** that aims to digitalize the process of various hotel operations including **booking, billing  and inventory management**. 

The main purpose is to **improve the performance** of the hotel by eradicating the daily paperwork in the admin section. With this system the tasks
would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and hotel would perform better than usual.The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the hotel check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the hotel.

## Purpose
This Web application was developed as a final project for my summer internship at WayToWeb Technologies.This project made me familiar with difficulties one can face during real-time project when working with PHP as backend and MySQl as Database.

## User Classes and Characteristics
There are **Two** types of users for our system. 

### 1. Customer
Customers interact with our system directly in order to book room, get bill and give feedback.The process of booking starts from customers placing order and then the other series of events begin.

### 2. Admin
Admin‚Äôs job is to manage the inventory and other information related to hotel room and can generate bill and see feedback message send by the customer.
